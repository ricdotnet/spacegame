### spacegame
Little space game made with java.

My intention is not to be a game dev
but be better at managing dynamic objects.

I feel that by taking a bit of game development it helps develop
data structure and algorithm skills.

The current score system only saves scores from the current play session.
The scores reset on restart.

The names are randomly generated from a pool of names.

#### TODO:
 - add enemies ✅
 - add life bar ✅
 - add lives ✅
 - menu frame ✅
 - power ups
 - difficulty increase
 - ask for player name before start
 - scoreboard with real names
